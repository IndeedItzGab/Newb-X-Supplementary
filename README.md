## QnA
## Patched APK is safe?
> Yes, it's safe it only has [MaterialBinLoader](https://github.com/ddf8196/MaterialBinLoader) injected in it, in order for you to use a RenderDragon Shader

### It's actually safe to use a modified APK/IPA?
> Actually no, modifying or using a cracked Minecraft is against the TOS of Mojang.

### Can we use the shader on the official Minecraft?
> No, currently Minecraft doesn't support Renderdragon Shader, you'll need a [MaterialBinLoader](https://github.com/ddf8196/MaterialBinLoader) injected in your APK in order to use them.
